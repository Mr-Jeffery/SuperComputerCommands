# Miniconda
## Installation
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
The terminal needs to be restarted.

## Create Environment
```bash
conda create -n my_env python=3.11 # or any other environment name and python version you need
conda activate my_env
conda install numpy
```
Alternatively, you can also create your environment to a specific directory:
```bash
conda create -p ./env python=3.11
```
### Clone New Environment
The following line will allow you to clone the existing Python environment to install new packages without messing up with current environments.
```bash
conda create -n my_env --clone base
```

## Install PyTorch with CUDA Support
### Check CUDA Version
First, you need to check your Cuda version accordingly.
If the node that you are configuring is the same as the computing node, you can use
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
to check your Cuda version from the output:
```

```
here at the upper right corner, we can see that the Cuda version is 11.8.

If you are using cuda installed from spack or loading module installed by the admin, `which nvcc` will work as well.

### Installation
*If you are installing newer versions of torch, just type `pip install torch` and it will include the GPU version for you.*

Suppose your cuda version is 11.7, then you can goto [https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117) to find the available torch version.
Then install with the following command:
```bash
pip3 install torch==1.13.1+cu117 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117 --no-cache-dir
```
[reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70340812/how-to-install-pytorch-with-cuda-support-with-pip-in-visual-studio)

After installation, you can use
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```
to check if your installation is successful.
